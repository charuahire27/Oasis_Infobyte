            <p id="img-caption">Virat Kohli  born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and former captain of the India
                 national team who plays as a right-handed batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic
                  cricket. Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,[3] Kohli holds the records for scoring most runs in T20
                   internationals and in the IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.
                    Kohli has also contributed to India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.

            <h1>Player profile</h1>
            <p>Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanor.
                 His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,[352] and
                  a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes,
                   and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.
                    In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favor playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits.
                     He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.
                     
                Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke.
                 He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[6] Having a
                  limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily
                   yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[357] Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and 
                   versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to 
                   display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that
                    disrupt traditional field positioning.[358] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and
                     sure-handedness.</p>
            <h2>Indian Premier League</h2>
            <p>After a successful performance in the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was signed by the Royal Challengers Bangalore for a sum of
                 $30,000 as a part youth contract.[308] He was the captain of the franchise for 8 seasons but was futile in winning trophies.[309]
                 
                However, his initial performances in the 2008 season were underwhelming, as evidenced by his statistics in the 2008 season, where
                 he managed only 165 runs in 12 innings, averaging 15.00 and striking at a rate of 105.09
                
                The following season, Kohli showed some improvement with 246 runs at an average of 22.36 and a strike rate of over 112.
                 Despite his improved individual performance, the team was unable to secure the championship, advancing as far as the final.
                 
                In the 2010 season, Kohli exhibited a more intermediate level of performance, finishing as the third-highest run-getter for 
                his team with 307 runs. He improved his average to 27.90 and his strike rate to 144.81, offering a glimpse of his potential
                 as a consistent contributor to his team's success.
                
                Prior to the 2011 season, Kohli was the singular player selected by the Royal Challengers franchise to retain his position on the
                 team. Appointed as the vice-captain, he exhibited his aptitude for command and authority when he captained the team during 
                 several matches in the absence of the regular captain, Daniel Vettori, due to injury. The Royal Challengers coach, Ray Jennings
                  praised Kohli, stating that the young man of 22 years held the potential to become the future captain not only of the franchise,
                   but of the Indian national team as well.[313] During the season, Kohli lived up to the expectations and was instrumental in
                    leading his team to the runner-up position. He amassed 557 runs, including four half-centuries, with an average of 46.41,
                     earning the distinction of being the second-highest run-scorer for the season, trailing only teammate Chris Gayle</p>
